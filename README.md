# Lunchroom

Built with React and Express

# Developer Setup

1. Clone this repository with `git` in whichever way you are most comfortable with
(Make sure you will be able to push later)  
2. Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your computer or [install it here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
3. Open up the directory/folder in Terminal, Powershell, or Command Prompt and run `npm i` to install dependencies.  
4. Create a file named `.env` at the root of the project and insert the environment variables into it in the
format `VARIABLE_NAME=VARIABLE_VALUE`.  
   * A `template.env` has been provided with the keys you need to fill out or change
5. Start the frontend with `npm start` or the backend with `nodemon server`  
   * The script should then automatically restart itself whenever changes are detected.

# Git Pull + create new branch

To ensure you are always creating a new branch with the most recent version of the dev branch, run this
command `git branch local-branch origin/dev`.   
This copies the entire dev branch on this GitHub repo onto a new local branch. To work on that branch,
run `git checkout local-branch`. Work on your task here.   
Every time you do this, it is a good idea to run `npm install` in both the lunchroom folder and the backend
folder (`cd backend`)

### Linting
To lint the frontend, run the following command:

```npm run lint```

To run the linter and fix all the errors, run the following command:

```npm run lint:fix```

# Development
The development of Profficient was an exciting journey that brought together the talents and skills of our team. We harnessed a range of technologies and tools to create a seamless and user-friendly platform for UCD students. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into our development process:
**Frontend:**

Our frontend development revolved around Figma, React, JavaScript, and CSS. Using Figma, we crafted intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces, ensuring a delightful experience for our users. React, with its component-based architecture, allowed us to build a responsive and interactive frontend. We utilized JavaScript, Chart.js, and CSS to add functionality and style, making Profficient both visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Backend:**

For the backend, we relied on Express.js and Node.js to power Profficientâ€™s server-side functionality. These technologies provided a robust foundation for handling requests, managing authentication with Google OAuth 2.0, and ensuring seamless data flow between the frontend and the database.

**Database:**

MongoDB served as the backbone of Profficientâ€™s database management. Its flexible document-oriented approach allowed us to store and retrieve data efficiently. We leveraged MongoDB to manage professor information, user reviews, and other relevant data, enabling students to access valuable insights easily.

**Project Maintenance:**

To ensure smooth project management and collaboration, we utilized Jira, Notion, and GitHub. Jira served as our central hub for tracking tasks, assigning responsibilities, and monitoring progress. Notion helped us stay organized with project documentation and sharing important resources. GitHub facilitated version control, code collaboration, and seamless deployment of updates.

# Beta testing

After completing the development of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we proceeded to conduct alpha testing within our team to ensure the initial functionality and usability of Profficient. Once we were satisfied with the internal testing results, we moved on to the exciting phase of beta testing with the wider UC Davis student community. We were thrilled to receive over 100 responses from enthusiastic students who eagerly provided constructive feedback.

The beta testing phase proved to be invaluable in refining and enhancing Profficient. We carefully reviewed all the feedback received and identified common pain points and areas for improvement. The studentsâ€™ input guided us in making multiple UI changes to better align the platform with their needs. We focused on optimizing user experience by addressing issues such as button placement, clarifying navigation, and overall ease of use.

The beta testing phase played a crucial role in making these important adjustments and ensuring that the platform truly meets the needs and expectations of its users. We are grateful to the UC Davis community for their enthusiastic engagement and look forward to launching the final version of Profficient with confidence, knowing that it has been thoroughly tested and improved based on the valuable input of its future users.

# Challenges

1. **Limited Design and Time Resources:**
   - Overcoming the challenge of limited design resources, such as graphic designers or UI/UX specialists, while aiming for visually appealing interfaces.
   - Managing time-consuming tasks like rebranding and its impact on the project timeline.

2. **Backend Optimization and Database Challenges:**
   - Overcoming challenges related to backend optimization, such as improving the performance of charting libraries like Chart.js.
   - Resolving issues with backend functionality, database connectivity, and authentication.

3. **Managing Desire for Broader Changes:**
   - Addressing the challenge of team members wanting to implement broader changes beyond the projectâ€™s scope or initial plans.
   - Finding a balance between innovation and project constraints, sometimes feeling like a group of explorers wanting to chart new territories while staying on the designated path.

# Takeaways

1. **Embracing the Power of Effective Planning:**
   - Investing time in comprehensive planning and defining project goals, requirements, and timelines set the foundation for our success. Our detailed project roadmap, Agile methodologies, and weekly sprints helped us stay organized and prioritize tasks effectively.

2. **Emphasize User-Centric Design:**
   - Designing a website without considering your users is like trying to teach a cat to fetch â€” itâ€™s just not going to work! We learned that we need to prioritize user research, incorporate feedback, and make sure our website speaks their language. After all, our users are the true MVPs (Most Valuable Persons)!

3. **Harness the Strengths of Each Team Member:**
   - Teamwork makes the dream work! It was important to recognize and leverage the unique skills and strengths of each team member; this leads to a harmonious collaboration. It was like having a superhero squad with each member bringing their own superpower to the table.

4. **Invest in Thorough Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Prioritizing thorough testing and quality assurance helped us identify and resolve issues early on. We found out that UCD students have a knack for spotting things we never thought of. User feedback truly kept us on our toes and helped us improve the overall experience.

5. **Effective Communication Fuels Productivity:**
   - Maintaining open and transparent communication channels within the team was vital for effective collaboration. Regular team meetings, daily stand-ups, and clear documentation streamlined our workflow and minimized misunderstandings.

# Closing Remarks âœ¨

In a nutshell, the Profficient project has been a wild ride! Weâ€™ve tackled the challenges faced by UC Davis students in finding the perfect professors and created a super cool platform. From nailing the planning phase to rocking the user-centric design, our team has hustled hard. Weâ€™ve learned so much along the way, like the power of teamwork, the importance of testing (thanks, eagle-eyed students!), and the need for open communication. Weâ€™re stoked about what weâ€™ve achieved and canâ€™t wait to see Profficient make waves in the UC Davis community. Cheers to an awesome future!
